# EEG Signals Analysis ðŸ§ 

## Project Overview
The EEG Signals Analysis project aims to explore and understand the electrical activity of the brain by analyzing EEG signals. EEG signals provide valuable information about various brain waves, such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves. Each of these waves corresponds to specific brain activities and states, offering insights into cognitive processes, emotions, and brain disorders.

## Signal Processing and Analysis
The project involves several key steps for processing and analyzing EEG signals:

1. **Signal Filtering**: EEG signals often contain noise and artifacts that can interfere with the analysis. Therefore, the project utilizes various filtering techniques to remove unwanted components and enhance the quality of the signals. Filtering methods such as high-pass, low-pass, or band-pass filters are employed to isolate specific frequency ranges of interest.

2. **Brain Wave Analysis**: After the signals have been filtered, the project focuses on analyzing different brain waves present in the EEG signals. This includes identifying and characterizing delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves. Each wave represents distinct brain activities and can provide insights into cognitive states, emotions, and potential brain disorders.

3. **Salt Bridge Detection**: Detection of salt bridges between electrodes to ensure proper electrical contact and minimize noise interference. Identifying and addressing salt bridges help improve signal quality and enhance the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

4. **EEGLab Analysis**: The data obtained from EEG signals is further analyzed using EEGLab, a widely-used interface for EEG analysis. EEGLab provides a comprehensive set of tools for preprocessing, feature extraction, statistical analysis, and visualization of EEG data. It facilitates the detection of emotions and the study of brain activity patterns, allowing for in-depth exploration of EEG signals.

## Repository Structure
