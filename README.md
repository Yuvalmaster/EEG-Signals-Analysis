## Project Description
The project aims to analyze and process physiological signals to extract meaningful information and gain insights into human health and well-being. 
- EEG Signals Analysis:
The EEG Signals Analysis project focuses on the analysis of signals obtained from electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the electrical activity of the brain. 
The project involves filtering and processing different brain waves present in the EEG signals, such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves. 
Each wave corresponds to specific brain activities and states, providing insights into cognitive processes, emotions, and brain disorders. 
Additionally, the project includes the detection of salt bridges between electrodes, which ensures accurate signal acquisition and reduces noise interference. 
The data obtained was further analysed in EEGLab, an interface widely used for EEG analysis, to detect emotions and study brain activity patterns.
